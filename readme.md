Lab 4 Wrap-Up â€“ Autonomous Driving: Car Detection
In this lab, you:

Reviewed CNN basics and their role in object detection.
Applied a pretrained YOLOv8 model to detect cars (and other objects) in road scenes.
Learned to draw bounding boxes and filter by class.
Experimented with confidence and IoU thresholds, seeing their effect on detections.
Completed Advanced Tasks:
Multi-class detection comparison (bar/pie charts).
Confidence threshold sweeps and their effect on car counts.
